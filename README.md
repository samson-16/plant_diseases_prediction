# 🌿 Plant Disease Recognition System
This project is a web-based system that uses machine learning to detect plant diseases from leaf images.
🧠 Models Used:
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) → feature extraction & classification
Random Forest → applied on CNN-extracted features for robust performance

## Features
- Upload or capture leaf images
- Top-3 prediction confidence
- Compare CNN vs. RF predictions
- View prediction history with timestamps
- Download results as CSV
- Multilingual interface (English & Amharic)

## echnologies
- Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- Streamlit for web interface
